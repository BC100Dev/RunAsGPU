# RunAsGPU
RunAsGPU is a tool designed to give users a nice way of controlling applications
on what GPU an application runs on. I decided to write this tool to overcome the
issue with the use of `DRI_PRIME`, which for some users may or may not include
certain issues. This tool also helps users that aren't too technical with CLI,
having a proper simple-to-use GUI. GUI should be simple to use with an App
Selection screen (yes, you add apps manually, sorry not sorry), you select the
app, and you run it. Simple GUI in mind, really.

## Use cases
Documentation coming up soon. This project will actually appear sooner than my
other projects, like for example, take
[OsintgramCXX](https://github.com/BC100Dev/OsintgramCXX) that actually takes
forever to finish.
